### Description
This project can help you find any job you're looking for on HeadHunter and SuperJob using a keyword of your choosing. 
Just type the word you think the profession you're lookng for has and the programme will show you relevant vacancies. 
You can easily find the job of your dream provided it can be summed up with one word. 

It all began some months ago when I decided to dabble into programming which, as it were, was bound to get me to this point,
wherein my software is capable of making one's life less stressful amid all the uncertainties humanity now faces, 
amid all of the layoffs unleashed upon my kind by tech giants, whose obsession with profit knows no bounds. 

So, one can only hope that these unassuming few lines of code shall afford a modicum of positive difference in my comrade-code
user's life
